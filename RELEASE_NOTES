This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
18.0. This is a major revision update of the toolchain. 

The 18.0 release is available for the following platforms:

1. Linux x64 host running Ubuntu 16.04 or later.
2. Windows x64 host running Windows 10 or later.
3. Linux ARM64 host running Ubuntu 16.04 or later.
4. Windows ARM64 host running Windows 10 or later.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will generate code for ARM and X86 targets and
will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by the llvm.org compiler.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 18.0 toolchain includes all changes in the llvm.org 18.1 release branch, 
and proprietary features and optimizations that are not available in the llvm.org 18.1 branch.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

The following link contains all the new features in the llvm.org 18.1 release
https://discourse.llvm.org/t/llvm-18-1-0-released/77448	(SDLLVM 18.0 is based on llvm.org 18.1 branch)


The following are the major changes specific to SDLLVM 18.0 

1. The Snapdragon LLVM toolchain includes LLVM based binutils. The legacy binutils in the tools/bin folder
   will be deprecated in 19.0 release. We request all customers to upgrade to LLVM based binutils. Please reach out
   to SDLLVM support for any help with this.

The following are the major changes from llvm.org 18.1 version that also impact SDLLVM 18.0

1. -mgeneral-regs-only flag will prevent using floating-point(FPCR,FPSR) and Neon/SVE registers in assembly
   from SDLLVM 18.0. Please use ".arch_extension fp\n" directive in the assembly to access floating point or SIMD
   registers when -mgeneral-regs-only flag is used

2. -mcmodel=large is no longer supported for PIC on AArch64
   -mcmodel option is no longer supported for aarch32 triples	
	
3. There is an output format change in the llvm-objdump disassembly utility. 
   This may require modifying your build system. Please contact SDLLVM support team for help with this.	

4. There are changes in this release that will impact sanitizers that use an ignore list. 

	a. The glob support is enabled by default for pattern matching in ignore lists (for sanitizers using -fsanitize-ignorelist=ignorelist.txt)
	b. If `#!special-case-list-v1` is the first line of the ignorelist then it falls back to support regex patterns
	c. It is recommended to migrate the ignore lists format from regex to glob.
